(from my email to p5p)

Notes:

- The "mesmoke.pl" is the live copy running on my Win32 VM.  The "mesmoke"
  copy is an untested attempt to remove the --split-smoke failure.

- The "prep_git() / split-smoke" stuff was a failed experiment back when 
  I was having Git run on my Linux host and the smoke run on the Win32 VM.
 
- You'll need Cygwin git.  Msysgit causes test failures.

- To run as a "smoke-me" client, the variables %COMMITTER_EMAIL% and
  %COMMITTER_NAME% are search/replaced in the Test::Smoke config hash  
  from a config file with ".template" appended.
  (ex: smoke-me_smoke.config.template -> smoke-me_smoke.config)

- I've attached my configurations as examples.  From what I remember,  
  forest mode is required and there's a variable that needs added to the
  Test::Smoke $conf configuration hash... maybe 'adir'? I forget.  Also,
  it needs configured to use "rsync" but have the rsync command be a no-op.

- There's no configuration file yet so many variables in the script need  
  changed per deployment.  Something to fix.

- On the second and subsequent runs it complains (in Win32 VM copy):
        Filehandle STDIN reopened as $dotpatch only for output at mesmoke.pl line 126.
        Filehandle STDIN reopened as $logfh only for output at mesmoke.pl line 177.
  I've yet to find the cause (Perl test suite closing filehandles?) but it
  doesn't seem to have a negative impact yet.

- To run for blead I do:
        perl.exe mesmoke.pl --pattern ^remotes/origin/blead$ --what blead
  for smoke-me it is simply:
        perl.exe mesmoke.pl

- You'll probably want to do:
        set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
  to silence a warning.
