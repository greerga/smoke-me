Samples of the templates I use for my own smoking.  You will need to adjust
the paths if you don't match the directories (and drives) that I use,
although it is better that you generate your own Test::Smoke configuration
really.  Just make sure to choose "forest" mode and sync with 'rsync' mode
but have the 'rsync' binary set to "/bin/true".

    WARNING: My Linux templates use 'make -j'!

The general directory structure expected is:

$HOME
    smoke/
        driver/
            logs/
                <branch>
            *.config.template
        perl/
            <branch>
                build/
                inter/
                source/
                    .git/

Commands I use to execute are:

    ./mesmoke --what blead_g++ --pattern '^remotes/origin/blead$' &
    ./mesmoke --what smoke-me_g++ &
    wait
